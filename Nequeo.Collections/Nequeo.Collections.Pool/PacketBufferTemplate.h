 *  Purpose :       
 *					Template class PacketBufferTemplate
 *
 *					Provides simple network packed buffer.
 *					
 *					When two computers communicate over a network, they send information to each other divided up into
					discrete chunks called packets. The networking layer of the computer’s operating system must pick up the
					packets and store them as they arrive. However, the computer might not have enough bandwidth to process
					all of them at once. Thus, the networking layer usually buffers, or stores, the packets until the higher
					layers have a chance to attend to them. The packets should be processed in the order they arrive, so this
					problem is perfect for a queue structure. Following is a small PacketBuffer class that stores incoming
					packets in a queue until they are processed. It’s a template so that different layers of the networking layer
					can use it for different kinds of packets, such as IP packets or TCP packets. It allows the client to specify a
					max size because operating systems usually limit the number of packets that can be stored, so as not to
					use too much memory. When the buffer is full, subsequently arriving packets are ignored
