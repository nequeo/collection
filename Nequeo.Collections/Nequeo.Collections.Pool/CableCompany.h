 *  Purpose :       
 *					Class CableCompany
 *
 *					One possible use of bitsets is tracking channels of cable subscribers. Each subscriber could have a
					bitset of channels associated with his or her subscription, with set bits representing the channels to
					which he or she actually subscribes. This system could also support “packages” of channels, also represented
					as bitsets, which represent commonly subscribed combinations of channels.

					The following CableCompany class is a simple example of this model. It uses two maps, each of string/
					bitset, storing the cable packages as well as the subscriber information.
