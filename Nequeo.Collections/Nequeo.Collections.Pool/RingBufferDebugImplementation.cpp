 *  File :          RingBufferDebugImplementation.cpp
 *  Purpose :       
 *					Class RingBufferDebugImplementation
 *
 *					Provides a simple debug buffer. The client specifies the number
 *					of entries in the constructor and adds messages with the addEntry()
 *					method. Once the number of entries exceeds the number allowed, new
 *					entries overwrite the oldest entries in the buffer.
 *
 *					The buffer also provides the option to print entries as they
 *					are added to the buffer. The client can specify an output stream
 *					in the constructor, and can reset it with the setOutput() method.
 *
 *					Finally, the buffer supports streaming to an output stream.
