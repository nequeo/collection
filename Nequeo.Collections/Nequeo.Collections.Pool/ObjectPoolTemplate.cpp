 *  File :          ObjectPoolTemplate.cpp
 *  Purpose :       
 *					Template class ObjectPoolTemplate
 *
 *					Provides an object pool that can be used with any class that provides a
 *					default constructor
 *
 *					The object pool constructor creates a pool of objects, which it hands out
 *					to clients when requested via the acquireObject() method. When a client is
 *					finished with the object it calls releaseObject() to put the object back
 *					into the object pool.
 *
 *					The constructor and destructor on each object in the pool will be called only
 *					once each for the lifetime of the program, not once per acquisition and release.
 *
 *					The primary use of an object pool is to avoid creating and deleting objects
 *					repeatedly. The object pool is most suited to applications that use large
 *					numbers of objects for short periods of time.
 *
 *					For efficiency, the object pool doesn’t perform sanity checks.
 *					It expects the user to release every acquired object exactly once.
 *					It expects the user to avoid using any objects that he or she has released.
 *
 *					It expects the user not to delete the object pool until every object
 *					that was acquired has been released. Deleting the object pool invalidates
 *					any objects that the user has acquired, even if they have not yet been released.
