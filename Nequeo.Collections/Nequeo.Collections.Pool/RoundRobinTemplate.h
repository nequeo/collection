 *  Purpose :       
 *					Template class RoundRobinTemplate
 *
 *					Provides simple round-robin semantics for a list of elements.
 *					Clients add elements to the end of the list with add().
 *
 *					getNext() returns the next element in the list, starting with the first,
 *					and cycling back to the first when the end of the list is reached.
 *
 *					remove() removes the element matching the argument.
